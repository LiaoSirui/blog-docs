You have access to multiple clusters from your main terminal through `kubectl` contexts. Write all those context names into `/opt/course/1/contexts`.

Next write a command to display the current context into `/opt/course/1/context_default_kubectl.sh`, the command should use `kubectl`.

Finally write a second command doing the same thing into `/opt/course/1/context_default_no_kubectl.sh`, but without the use of `kubectl`.

```bash
kubectl config get-contexts -o name > /opt/course/1/contexts

kubectl config current-context

grep "current-context" ~/.kube/config | awk '{print $2}'
```

## Question 2

Task weight: 3%

Use context: `kubectl config use-context k8s-c1-H`

Create a single *Pod* of image `httpd:2.4.41-alpine` in *Namespace* `default`. The *Pod* should be named `pod1` and the container should be named `pod1-container`. This *Pod* should **only** be scheduled on controlplane nodes. Do not add new labels to any nodes.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod1
  namespace: default
spec:
  containers:
  - name: pod1-container
    image: httpd:2.4.41-alpine
  nodeSelector:
    node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane: ""
  tolerations:
   - key: "node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane"
     operator: "Exists"
     effect: "NoSchedule"

```

## Question 3

Task weight: 1%

Use context: `kubectl config use-context k8s-c1-H`

There are two *Pods* named `o3db-*` in *Namespace* `project-c13`. C13 management asked you to scale the *Pods* down to one replica to save resources.

```bash
# 确认控制器类型
kubectl get all -n project-c13

# 减少副本
kubectl scale statefulset -n project-c13 o3db --replicas 1
```

## Question 4

Task weight: 4%

Use context: `kubectl config use-context k8s-c1-H`

Do the following in *Namespace* `default`. Create a single *Pod* named `ready-if-service-ready` of image `nginx:1.16.1-alpine`. Configure a LivenessProbe which simply executes command `true`. Also configure a ReadinessProbe which does check if the url `http://service-am-i-ready:80` is reachable, you can use `wget -T2 -O- http://service-am-i-ready:80 `for this. Start the *Pod* and confirm it isn't ready because of the ReadinessProbe.

Create a second *Pod* named `am-i-ready` of image `nginx:1.16.1-alpine` with label `id: cross-server-ready`. The already existing *Service* `service-am-i-ready` should now have that second *Pod* as endpoint.

Now the first *Pod* should be in ready state, confirm that.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: ready-if-service-ready
  namespace: default
spec:
  containers:
  - name: ready-if-service-ready
    image: nginx:1.16.1-alpine

        command:
        - wget
        - -T
        - "2"
        - -O
        - "-"
        - http://service-am-i-ready:80

## Question 5

Task weight: 1%

Use context: `kubectl config use-context k8s-c1-H`

There are various *Pods* in all namespaces. Write a command into `/opt/course/5/find_pods.sh` which lists all *Pods* sorted by their AGE (`metadata.creationTimestamp`).

Write a second command into `/opt/course/5/find_pods_uid.sh` which lists all *Pods* sorted by field `metadata.uid`. Use `kubectl` sorting for both commands.

```bash
kubectl get po -A --sort-by '{metadata.creationTimestamp}'

kubectl get po -A --sort-by '{metadata.uid}'
```

## Question 6

Task weight: 8%

Use context: `kubectl config use-context k8s-c1-H`

Create a new *PersistentVolume* named `safari-pv`. It should have a capacity of *2Gi*, accessMode *ReadWriteOnce*, hostPath `/Volumes/Data` and no storageClassName defined.

Next create a new *PersistentVolumeClaim* in *Namespace* `project-tiger` named `safari-pvc` . It should request *2Gi* storage, accessMode *ReadWriteOnce* and should not define a storageClassName. The *PVC* should bound to the *PV* correctly.

Finally create a new *Deployment* `safari` in *Namespace* `project-tiger` which mounts that volume at `/tmp/safari-data`. The *Pods* of that *Deployment* should be of image `httpd:2.4.41-alpine`.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1

## Question 7

Task weight: 1%

Use context: `kubectl config use-context k8s-c1-H`

The metrics-server has been installed in the cluster. Your college would like to know the kubectl commands to:

1. show *Nodes* resource usage
2. show *Pods* and their containers resource usage

Please write the commands into `/opt/course/7/node.sh` and `/opt/course/7/pod.sh`.

```bash
kubectl top nodes

kubectl top pods --containers
```

## Question 8

Task weight: 2%

Use context: `kubectl config use-context k8s-c1-H`

Ssh into the controlplane node with `ssh cluster1-controlplane1`. Check how the controlplane components kubelet, kube-apiserver, kube-scheduler, kube-controller-manager and etcd are started/installed on the controlplane node. Also find out the name of the DNS application and how it's started/installed on the controlplane node.

Write your findings into file `/opt/course/8/controlplane-components.txt`. The file should be structured like:

```
# /opt/course/8/controlplane-components.txt
kubelet: [TYPE]
kube-apiserver: [TYPE]
kube-scheduler: [TYPE]
kube-controller-manager: [TYPE]
etcd: [TYPE]
dns: [TYPE] [NAME]
```

Choices of `[TYPE]` are: `not-installed`, `process`, `static-pod`, `pod`

```bash
ssh cluster1-controlplane1

# /opt/course/8/controlplane-components.txt
kubelet: process
kube-apiserver: static-pod
kube-scheduler: static-pod
kube-controller-manager: static-pod
etcd: static-pod
dns: pod coredns
```

## Question 9

Task weight: 5%

Use context: `kubectl config use-context k8s-c2-AC`

Ssh into the controlplane node with `ssh cluster2-controlplane1`. **Temporarily** stop the kube-scheduler, this means in a way that you can start it again afterwards.

Create a single *Pod* named `manual-schedule` of image `httpd:2.4-alpine`, confirm it's created but not scheduled on any node.

Now you're the scheduler and have all its power, manually schedule that *Pod* on node cluster2-controlplane1. Make sure it's running.

Start the kube-scheduler again and confirm it's running correctly by creating a second *Pod* named `manual-schedule2` of image `httpd:2.4-alpine` and check if it's running on cluster2-node1.

```bash
ssh cluster2-controlplane1

mv /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-scheduler.yaml /root/
```

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: manual-schedule
spec:
  nodeName: cluster2-controlplane1
  containers:
  - name: httpd
    image: httpd:2.4-alpine

Use context: `kubectl config use-context k8s-c1-H`

Create a new *ServiceAccount* `processor` in *Namespace* `project-hamster`. Create a *Role* and *RoleBinding*, both named `processor` as well. These should allow the new *SA* to only create *Secrets* and *ConfigMaps* in that *Namespace*.

```bash
kubectl create role processor -n project-hamster --verb=create --resource=secrets,configmaps
kubectl create sa processor -n project-hamster
kubectl create rolebinding processor --role=processor --serviceaccount=project-hamster:processor --namespace=project-hamster
```

## Question 11

Task weight: 4%

Use context: `kubectl config use-context k8s-c1-H`

Use *Namespace* `project-tiger` for the following. Create a *DaemonSet* named `ds-important` with image `httpd:2.4-alpine` and labels `id=ds-important` and `uuid=18426a0b-5f59-4e10-923f-c0e078e82462`. The *Pods* it creates should request 10 millicore cpu and 10 mebibyte memory. The *Pods* of that *DaemonSet* should run on all nodes, also controlplanes.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: ds-important
  namespace: project-tiger
  labels:
    id: ds-important
    uuid: 18426a0b-5f59-4e10-923f-c0e078e82462

```

## Question 12

Task weight: 6%

Use context: `kubectl config use-context k8s-c1-H`

Use *Namespace* `project-tiger` for the following. Create a *Deployment* named `deploy-important` with label `id=very-important` (the `Pods` should also have this label) and 3 replicas. It should contain two containers, the first named `container1` with image `nginx:1.17.6-alpine` and the second one named container2 with image `google/pause`.

There should be only ever **one** *Pod* of that *Deployment* running on **one** worker node. We have two worker nodes: `cluster1-node1` and `cluster1-node2`. Because the *Deployment* has three replicas the result should be that on both nodes **one** *Pod* is running. The third *Pod* won't be scheduled, unless a new worker node will be added.

In a way we kind of simulate the behaviour of a *DaemonSet* here, but using a *Deployment* and a fixed number of replicas.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: deploy-important
  namespace: project-tiger
  labels:
    id: very-important
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:

      - name: container2
        image: google/pause
```

## Question 13

*Task weight: 4%*

Use context: `kubectl config use-context k8s-c1-H`

Create a *Pod* named `multi-container-playground` in *Namespace* `default` with three containers, named `c1`, `c2` and `c3`. There should be a volume attached to that *Pod* and mounted into every container, but the volume shouldn't be persisted or shared with other *Pods*.

Container `c1` should be of image `nginx:1.17.6-alpine` and have the name of the node where its *Pod* is running available as environment variable MY_NODE_NAME.

Container `c2` should be of image `busybox:1.31.1` and write the output of the `date` command every second in the shared volume into file `date.log`. You can use `while true; do date >> /your/vol/path/date.log; sleep 1; done` for this.

Container `c3` should be of image `busybox:1.31.1` and constantly send the content of file `date.log` from the shared volume to stdout. You can use `tail -f /your/vol/path/date.log` for this.

Check the logs of container `c3` to confirm correct setup.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: multi-container-playground
  namespace: default
spec:
  volumes:
  - name: cache-volume
    emptyDir: {}

## Question 15

*Task weight: 3%*

Use context: `kubectl config use-context k8s-c2-AC`

Write a command into `/opt/course/15/cluster_events.sh` which shows the latest events in the whole cluster, ordered by time (`metadata.creationTimestamp`). Use `kubectl` for it.

Now delete the kube-proxy *Pod* running on node cluster2-node1 and write the events this caused into `/opt/course/15/pod_kill.log`.

Finally kill the containerd container of the kube-proxy *Pod* on node cluster2-node1 and write the events into `/opt/course/15/container_kill.log`.

Do you notice differences in the events both actions caused?

```bash
kubectl get events --sort-by '{metadata.creationTimestamp}'

crictl pods |grep kube-proxy 
crictl rmp 68fe8b2f89a81
crictl stopp 68fe8b2f89a81 && crictl rmp 68fe8b2f89a81

In *Namespace* `project-tiger` create a *Pod* named `tigers-reunite` of image `httpd:2.4.41-alpine` with labels `pod=container` and `container=pod`. Find out on which node the *Pod* is scheduled. Ssh into that node and find the containerd container belonging to that *Pod*.

Using command `crictl`:

1. Write the ID of the container and the `info.runtimeType` into `/opt/course/17/pod-container.txt`
2. Write the logs of the container into `/opt/course/17/pod-container.log`

## Question 18

*Task weight: 8%*

Use context: `kubectl config use-context k8s-c3-CCC`

There seems to be an issue with the kubelet not running on `cluster3-node1`. Fix it and confirm that cluster has node `cluster3-node1` available in Ready state afterwards. You should be able to schedule a *Pod* on `cluster3-node1` afterwards.

Write the reason of the issue into `/opt/course/18/reason.txt`.

## Question 19

*Task weight: 3%*

> **NOTE:** This task can only be solved if questions 18 or 20 have been successfully implemented and the k8s-c3-CCC cluster has a functioning worker node

Use context: `kubectl config use-context k8s-c3-CCC`

Do the following in a new *Namespace* `secret`. Create a *Pod* named `secret-pod` of image `busybox:1.31.1` which should keep running for some time.

There is an existing *Secret* located at `/opt/course/19/secret1.yaml`, create it in the *Namespace* `secret` and mount it readonly into the *Pod* at `/tmp/secret1`.

Create a new *Secret* in *Namespace* `secret` called `secret2` which should contain `user=user1` and `pass=1234`. These entries should be available inside the *Pod's* container as environment variables APP_USER and APP_PASS.

Confirm everything is working.

## Question 20

*Task weight: 10%*

Use context: `kubectl config use-context k8s-c3-CCC`

Your coworker said node `cluster3-node2` is running an older Kubernetes version and is not even part of the cluster. Update Kubernetes on that node to the exact version that's running on `cluster3-controlplane1`. Then add this node to the cluster. Use kubeadm for this.

## Question 21

*Task weight: 2%*

Use context: `kubectl config use-context k8s-c3-CCC`

Create a `Static Pod` named `my-static-pod` in *Namespace* `default` on cluster3-controlplane1. It should be of image `nginx:1.16-alpine` and have resource requests for `10m` CPU and `20Mi` memory.

Then create a NodePort *Service* named `static-pod-service` which exposes that static *Pod* on port 80 and check if it has *Endpoints* and if it's reachable through the `cluster3-controlplane1` internal IP address. You can connect to the internal node IPs from your main terminal.

## Question 22

*Task weight: 2%*

Use context: `kubectl config use-context k8s-c2-AC`

Check how long the kube-apiserver server certificate is valid on `cluster2-controlplane1`. Do this with openssl or cfssl. Write the exipiration date into `/opt/course/22/expiration`.

Also run the correct `kubeadm` command to list the expiration dates and confirm both methods show the same date.

Write the correct `kubeadm` command that would renew the apiserver server certificate into `/opt/course/22/kubeadm-renew-certs.sh`.

## Question 23

*Task weight: 2%*

Use context: `kubectl config use-context k8s-c2-AC`

Node cluster2-node1 has been added to the cluster using `kubeadm` and TLS bootstrapping.

Find the "Issuer" and "Extended Key Usage" values of the cluster2-node1:

1. kubelet **client** certificate, the one used for outgoing connections to the kube-apiserver.
2. kubelet **server** certificate, the one used for incoming connections from the kube-apiserver.

Write the information into file `/opt/course/23/certificate-info.txt`.

Compare the "Issuer" and "Extended Key Usage" fields of both certificates and make sense of these.

## Question 24

*Task weight: 9%*

Use context: `kubectl config use-context k8s-c1-H`

There was a security incident where an intruder was able to access the whole cluster from a single hacked backend *Pod*.

To prevent this create a *NetworkPolicy* called `np-backend` in *Namespace* `project-snake`. It should allow the `backend-*` *Pods* only to:

- connect to `db1-*` *Pods* on port 1111
- connect to `db2-*` *Pods* on port 2222

Use the `app` label of *Pods* in your policy.

After implementation, connections from `backend-*` *Pods* to `vault-*` *Pods* on port 3333 should for example no longer work.

## Question 25

*Task weight: 8%*

Use context: `kubectl config use-context k8s-c3-CCC`

Make a backup of etcd running on cluster3-controlplane1 and save it on the controlplane node at `/tmp/etcd-backup.db`.

Then create any kind of *Pod* in the cluster.

Finally restore the backup, confirm the cluster is still working and that the created *Pod* is no longer with us.
